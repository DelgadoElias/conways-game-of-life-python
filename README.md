# Conway's Game of Life in Python

Implementation of Conway's "Game Of Life" with some variants to keep fun.

I learned this from [Matheus Gomez](https://matgomes.com/conways-game-of-life-python/). Credits and more information 
about Matheus at the end of the text. 

The engine is entirely and purely implemented using vanilla
Python, and [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) for
the graphics front.

## Running The Game

I use Python3.10 on a virtual environment (VirtualEnv) but the main creator recommends use Python3.9 to this project.

I installed all the dependencies with:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Given that all the dependencies were installed, running the
game is as simple as

```shell
python main.py
```

## Credits

[Matheus Gomez](https://matgomes.com/conways-game-of-life-python/) Created the base of the code. I only added some lines
to try some things in Python and have fun.

can be implemented in a few lines of Python](https://matgomes.com/conways-game-of-life-python).
